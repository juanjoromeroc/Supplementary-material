Surrogate-based Optimization of Capture Chromatography Platforms for the Improvement of Computational Efficiency
The file optimization will perform a Mixed integer optimization
to run this file it is necesary:
1. An exel file for a library of brekthrough data results [fracret, maxbt, Capacity] (Library.xlsx).
2. A macros exel file to control the SuperPro simulation (Capture membrane.xlsm).
3. A Superpro flowshet simulation (Capture membrane.spf).
